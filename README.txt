How to run my code for assignment one.

1. Download the code from github at the following URL: https://github.com/funkjo/SupervisedLearning

2. Navigate to the working directory: SupervisedLearning/

3. Create an Anaconda environment or create a virtual environment. The Python version is preferably 3.8 or later

4. Run the command conda install --file requirements.txt for an Anaconda environment or run the command pip install requirements.txt

5. There are two notebooks, beans.ipynb and cars_eda.ipynb. Both notebooks implement the five machine learning algorithms but on different classification problems.

6. Please reach out to my Georgia Tech email if there are any issues.
